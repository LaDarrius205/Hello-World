What's up, LaDarrius here! Music is my first love and Basketball is my second, im starting to fall for coding, but i dont think she is falling for me just yet.
I remember a phrase from my first coding teacher that keeps my making attemps even though she keeps shooting me down, "Programmers are not born, they are made!"
